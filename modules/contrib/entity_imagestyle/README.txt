This module allows users to specify image styles on an entity-to-entity basis.
On entity create/edit pages, for every image field attached to the entity, this
module will create a control that allows users to specify an image style
specific to the entity and the field.

To put this user-supplied style to use, simply choose the "Entity image style"
formatter for your display. In the formatter settings, you can supply a default
image style to use if the user has not provided one.

The entity image styles module could be useful if you want to give editors a
greater degree of control over the image sizes/shapes/styles on the nodes that
they administer, while still restricting them to using defined styles.
