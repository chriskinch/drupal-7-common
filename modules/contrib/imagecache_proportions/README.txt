This module provides a CCK formatter for image fields that allows the user to
select between three different image styles depending on the proportions of the
original image.
If the image is more or less squared (you can set a looseness in pixels) you
will be able to select a squared style, if the image is wider than higher, you
can select a more "horizontal" style and if it's higher than wider, a more 
"vertical" one.

Configuration
=============
- Create the styles for the wider image, the higher and the squared one.
- Manage the field display settings for your image field, select which image style
you would like to use for each proportion and the looseness for the squard ones.
